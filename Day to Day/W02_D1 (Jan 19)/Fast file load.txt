Some students were asking about the fastest way to load a file.
Here it is. 

I would **NOT** suggest using this, but it's here if you want to know.
(It loads the file as a giant array of bytes -char- that you then have 
 to deal with. BUT the RAM/Memory is 1000-10,000 TIMES faster than your
 hard drive, so there's that.)

	// Scan to the end to get the size
	theFile.seekg(0, std::ios::end);
	std::ios::pos_type fileSize = theFile.tellg();
	// Return to start
	theFile.seekg(0, std::ios::beg);

	char* pRawData = new char[static_cast<unsigned int>(fileSize)];
	theFile.read(pRawData, fileSize);
	theFile.close();
