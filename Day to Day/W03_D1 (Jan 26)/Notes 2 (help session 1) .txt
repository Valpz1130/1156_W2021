What is a "built in" or "native" type (i.e. that corresponds to the hardware of the CPU)?


What is the difference between an int and an unsigned int? 
(i.e. why would you use one and not the other?)

What kind of a warning could you get with this code?

unsigned int a = 0;
std::cint >> a;
int b = a;	// WARNING HERE


What kind of warning could you get with this code?

float a;
std::cin >> a;
if ( a ) 		// WARNING HERE
{
	// etc.
	
	
++x is faster than x++. (T/F)


What does "auto" do (since C++11)?
