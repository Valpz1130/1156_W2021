Pick a randon name for my new baby!

Complete the code (from Thursday) to pick a baby name

Split it into separate files
Share a bunch of variables (like the main array)
BONUS: see if you can "parse out" the commas, etc.
ANOTHER BONUS: see if you can add the gender:
Pass "F" or "M" or "N" (non-binary)
Pick a name, if it matches F/M, return it.
If it doesn't match, just pick another, or scan until you find "F"/"M", or do it some other way!
(Picking another takes almost no time and is REALLY simple)
If it's "N", pick any name you'd like.
This isn't going to be marked, but if you finish it, Lady Gaga will come to your street and sing!!! #truestory.
