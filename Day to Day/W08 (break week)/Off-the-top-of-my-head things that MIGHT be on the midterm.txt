There's no lecture, but I'm around from 12-2 if there's questions, etc. 

Sorry for the delay, but the marks are *almost* done for project 1 (posting this afternoon).


Some things to focus on for the mid-term:
- Work on your projects (#1 if you didn't get it working, or #2)

(I'll send a more comprehensive list, too)
* Basic types ("strongly typed"), so casting, etc.
* How strings are stored (trailing \0)
* "C-style" arrays (so this: int myArray[10], cMonster myArray[100], etc.)
* vectors, loading, using, etc.
* Loading things into array and vectors
* Finding things in arrays and vectors
* "deleting" things from arrays/vectors
    - You can use erase() on a vector, but it's really a
	  "shift everything to overwrite the values"
	  (The point is that the index values won't stay the same *after* 
	   the deleted thing)
* functions & methods:
	* Passing by value and by reference
* Using basic classes (think cPerson, cMonster, etc.)
  - This is mostly "here's a class", so use it, and you /might/ 
    have to add something to it. 
* Header (.h) and implementation (.cpp) files:
  - class definitions in header
  - "code" into the cpp files (with the "::" scope for the class)
  - Header guards 
* Using strings + things that "look like strings"
  - Think the "postal code" in the cPerson
* File and other stream input (cin, fstream, stringstream, etc.)
* Using an enum

* There will be a bonus about pointers, but that will be a "final exam" topic
* Iterators, algorithm library, and predicate functions/functors are NOT on the mid-term, either
