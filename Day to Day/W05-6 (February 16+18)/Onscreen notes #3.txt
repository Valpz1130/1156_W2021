Pointers are specified with a "*"


int x;
int* px;		// Pointer to an int

You set them by getting the "address of" or &

px = &x;		// Set px to the "address of" x

To "get at" what it's pointing to, use the "*" (looks like the end of an arrow)

cout << px;			// Prints ACTUAL MEMORY LOCATION (useless)
cout << *px;		// The thing it's pointing to

Use pointer for heap variables 

cMonster* pTheMon = new cMonster();		// Points to a monster

Can still "dereference", but not usually this

cout << (*pTheMon).FirstName;	// Odd, but valid
cout << pTheMon->FirstName;		// Better and WAY more useful

When you are done, call "delete" on the variables.
